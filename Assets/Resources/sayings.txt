Was on their way to attend Sunday School.
Just received the Medal of Honor.
Just bought tickets to the "Beyond Say" Concert.
I pity da foo'.
Was stuck between a rock and a hard place.
Wouldn't harm a fly.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Back to square one.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Elvis has left the building.
Probably not playing possum.
Who shot the sheriff?
Unleash the beast.
Was always second best in the family (of two).
Just submitted a Game Jam entry.
Was actively committing a felony.
Just saw the light at the end of the tunnel.
Found love in their final moments.
Always paid their taxes.
Did not live to see another day.
Found their soulmate just the other day.
Was fit as a fiddle.
Counted their chickens before they hatched.
Got the short end of the stick.
Rolled with the punches one too many times.
Died doing what he loved.
